# Heterogeneous RAG for Labour Market Analysis (FR/EU)

This repository contains a research project exploring **heterogeneous Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** applied to **labour market data** from French and EU public policy reports.

The project processes:
- **PDF documents** (INSEE, EU Commission, Eurostat)
- **text extraction**
- **cleaned statistical tables (CSV)**
- **bilingual data (FR + EN)**

And it builds a RAG pipeline capable of retrieving information from **text + tables** and answering analytical labour-market questions.
